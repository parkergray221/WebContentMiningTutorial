    <h3>   Web-Wide Tracking</h3>
    <p class="tab">
    “Web-wide tracking” tracks an individual across all sites they visit and is predictably a controversial technology.

    <h3> Understanding Web Communities-AOL  </h3>
    <p class="tab">
    One of the biggest successes for America Online has been its sizable and loyal customer base. A large portion of this customer base participates in various AOL communities, which are collections of users with similar interests. Over time these communities have grown to be well-visited waterholes for AOL users with shared interests.
   Applying web mining to the data collected from community interactions provides AOL with a very good understanding of its communities, which it has used for targeted marketing through advertisements and e-mail solicitation.
