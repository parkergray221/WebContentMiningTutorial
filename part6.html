    Web mining as a discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon, really only rearing its head in the early 2000s. The discipline has rapidly gained relevance due to its utility in understanding website design. As we've covered here, web content mining has quite a lot of utility-
    it's very <b>scalable</b> in its quantity of data, it has several <b>user-friendly</b> solutions even for people without a computer science background, and it delivers with great <b>accuracy</b> the results you would want from your query. This all is no big surprise- Web content mining's 
    objective is to <i>gather, organize, categorize, and provide</i> the user with the best possible information available per website being examined, and it can only do this if it's scalable, user-friendly, and precise all at once. Perhaps the key attribute of a good web miner is knowing 
    exactly <i>what</i> to say in a query to get precisely the desired data

    Presently, web page content extraction is a critical step in data analysis of many technologies. The process of content mining will become increasingly difficult (and perhaps more important) as time carries on with companies created webpages with more complex content 
    and organization, or adopt new non-SGML languages as their implementation language. Web content mining algorithms will have to adapt to these sorts of changes in future design as well as always be keeping those three attributes- scalability, user-friendliness, and 
    accuracy- front and center.
